#+TITLE: Plans for groph

* TODO Change Visited att of traversal.Search from Bitset to Heap
- After fnishing one cluster finding the next start vertex is a linear
  search on Visited. This does not scale.
- Having a hit counter for each vertex lets one detect cycles easily
- Putting the hit counter in a heap make the whole this scale better

*Note:* To do cycle detection on /undirected/ graphs one must not
count a hit when gonig v0 -> v1 -> v0.

* DONE Remove DelEdge from WGi32
=DelEdge= is redundant, one can already use =SetWeight(u, v, nil)=.
